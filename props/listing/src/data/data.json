We are putting a stop to that. “Custom” is no longer synonymous with long wait times. \n\n*Please note that paint adds an additional 3 business days (to allow for paint application and dry time). We paint the front and sides of our pieces (NOT the back).\n\nFULLY CUSTOMIZED~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGet your name (or any word you would like) cut from wood to display beautifully in your home. Perfect for children&#39;s names in their room or nursery, family last names over the fireplace, “Let’s Eat” in the kitchen, or “Splish Splash” in the bathroom. The options are endless!\n\nORDERING~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*Our sizing is based off of the total width of the name (from left to right), NOT the height. The height varies depending on the letters and font, so if you need exact measurements on the height, please contact us first. \n\n*If you would like to order a first and middle name and select one as your quantity (such as Lucy Mae at 42&quot; wide), please keep in mind that the 2 names will measure a *total* width of the size you select. (We do not recommend ordering a size smaller than 42&quot; wide for 2 names.)\n\n* Please let us know the name(s) or word(s) you are wanting in the Personalization field, exactly as you would like the finished product. Please leave a VERY specific note if you want your word all lowercase.\n\n*If you have a lowercase &quot;i&quot; or &quot;j&quot; please let us know if you would like us to connect the dot to the letter, or if you would like it sent loose. If no note is given, we will automatically ship it CONNECTED.\n\n*Please note that unless there are VERY specific instructions given, we will automatically cut all orders with the first letter of the word or name uppercase and all other letters lowercase.  (Example: jennifer will be cut as Jennifer, unless a note is included to make all letters lowercase.)\n\nPROOFS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWe provide proofs after purchase and by request only.  Please note that we cannot guarantee that your unpainted name will ship within 48 hours when a proof is requested, due to proof design and response wait time.\n\nSPECS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*Sizes range from 12&quot; to 55&quot; wide (from left to right of your entire name). The height varies depending on the letters, so if you need exact measurements on the height, please contact us first.  Keep in mind, the more letters in the name, the smaller the font will become.  The name Lucy at 36&quot; wide will be MUCH taller than the name Annabelle at 36&quot; wide.\n\n*Cut from ½” Baltic Birch wood.\n\n*Please note, our pieces do not come with any hanging hardware.\n\nADD-ON OPTIONS~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDon&#39;t want to put nails in the wall?
